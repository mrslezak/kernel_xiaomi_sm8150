LOS M.O.D. ALPHA KERNEL

This is meant to be forked. Features added:
F2FS support for data/cache (works)
LZ4 compression added for ZRAM (works)
830mhz GPU clock added and enabled (need to lock in with a kernel manager - i.e. fix mix/max frequency to 830mhz)
Fsync Franco kernel toggle added (works)

DOES NOT HAVE SOUND, WIFI, AND CRASHES ON PHONE CALLS!!!!  ALPHA!  ALL ELSE WORKS (LTE Data, Camera, Bluetooth, etc.)

For someone else who wants a modified LOS kernel to fork and fix.
