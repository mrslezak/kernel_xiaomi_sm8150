LOS M.O.D. KERNEL

Update - on newest LOS this kernel is confirmed to work properly.
All GPU OC functions, F2FS, LZ4, and Fsync toggle work.

OLD INFO:
This is meant to be forked. Not yet tested on LOS but builds and boots on Xiaomi ROMs without Wifi or Sound or phone calls.
This is expected as Lineage OS swaps out the Vendor modules (included here) and has its own flash routine to use custom libs.
Will not work without installing the (un)official Lineage OS first, then applying the kernel patches!!!!

Features added:
F2FS support for data/cache (works)
LZ4 compression added for ZRAM (works)
830mhz GPU clock added and enabled (need to lock in with a kernel manager - i.e. fix mix/max frequency to 830mhz)
Fsync Franco kernel toggle added (works)

Includes a zip file that has installation instructions and the required modules (Wifi / Sound) to be copied to Vendor as well
as the fstab.qcom file to enable F2FS partitions on data and cache.  The install process will require several reboots and will 
swap out the kernel, you must patch it with Magisk 19.4 (included), and swap out vendor modules (TWRP 3.3.1.41+ Mauronofrio required).
Instructions are in the zip file which does most of the work for you.

I have not gotten the official installation instructions and to my knowledge a commit is missing from this fork that will prevent it
from properly initializing the modules.  An init.rc script swaps the Xiaomi ones with the LOS replacements:
